print(x + y) # if i enter 23 as x and 3 as y then it will print 233 becuse it is a string and python is not able to add two strings
h = int(input("Enter first number: "))
j = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print(h + j) # if i enter 23 as x and 3 as y then it will print 26 becaue it is a integer and python is able to add two integers and we can also write as print(int(x)+int(y))
