a = 1
b = 2
print(a + b) # output (3) beacuse a and b are int.

a = "1"
b = "2"
print(a +b) # output (12) beacuse a and b are string and python dosen't add them.

Types:
a.Exllicit typecasting (done by programmer or their own choice) 

(1) a = "1"
    b = "2"
    print(int(a) + int(b)) # first pythom convert string into int and then add them.

(2) string = "15"
    number = 7
    string_number = int(string) #throws an error if the string is not a valid integer
    sum= number + string_number
    print("The Sum of both the numbers is: ", sum)

b.Imlicit typecasting (python do it automatically)

c = 1.9
d = 8
print(c + d) # output (9.9) beacuse python convert d into float and add them
